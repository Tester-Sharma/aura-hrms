=====================================================================PAYROLL & ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Prototype –
Manufacturing & Industrial Use Case
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This system is a Payroll and Attendance Management Prototype designed
specifically for manufacturing factories and industrial environments, where
hour-based work tracking is critical and both workers and salaried employees
operate together.
The system focuses on:
Accurate attendance tracking
Hour-based salary calculation
Simple leave management
Transparent salary visibility
Payslip PDF generation
The goal of this prototype is clarity, usability, and functional correctness,
not enterprise-level complexity.
2. USER ROLES
2.1 Employee / Worker
Views own profile, attendance, salary, and payslips
Punches in and out
Applies for leave
Tracks worked hours and earnings
2.2 HR (Administrator)
Manages employees and workers
Approves or rejects leave
Monitors attendance
Configures salary structures
Generates payslips
3. CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Hour-based system first (critical for factories)
Minimal UI & simple workflows
Read-only salary visibility for employees
Single source of truth: attendance
Automation wherever possible
Prototype-ready, demo-friendly
4. EMPLOYEE / WORKER PORTAL – DETAILED FEATURES
4.1 Profile & Employment Details
Each employee or worker has a dedicated profile section containing:
Personal Information:
Name
Employee ID
Contact details
Job Information:
Designation

Total working days (monthly)
Expected total working hours
Actual worked hours
Pending / deficit hours
Overtime hours
This allows workers to immediately understand:
Whether they are underworking or overworking
Impact on salary
5.3 Attendance History Table

Reason
Current status
HR actions:
Approve
Reject
System effects:
Attendance updated
Salary recalculated if needed
7.4 Attendance Monitoring (HR View)
HR can:
View attendance summary cards per employee
Drill down into month-wise detailed attendance
See total hours, OT hours, absences
Attendance editing is restricted in prototype to maintain data integrity.
8. SALARY CALCULATION LOGIC (SYSTEM RULES)
8.1 Worker Salary (Hourly-Based)
Salary = (Worked Hours × Hourly Rate) + (OT Hours × OT Rate)
No fixed monthly salary
Attendance is the only salary driver
8.2 Employee Salary (Monthly-Based)
Payable Salary = (Actual Worked Hours / Expected Monthly Hours) × Monthly CTC
Leave and absences affect worked hours
Ensures fairness and transparency
9. PAYSLIP PDF GENERATION (CORE FEATURE)
